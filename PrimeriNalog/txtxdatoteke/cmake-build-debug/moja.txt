Modifies the elements
 in the array pointed
  by s and the stream object.
Concurrent access to the
same stream object may
 cause data races, except
 for the standard stream
 object cin when this is
 synchronized with stdio
 (in this case, no data races are initiated,
  although no guarantees are given on the order
   in which
extracted characters are attributed
 to threads).
